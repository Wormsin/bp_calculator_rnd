# Deal Profit Predictor-Calculator

## Description

The **Deal Profit Predictor-Calculator** is an AI-driven tool designed to estimate and optimize the profitability of deals, taking into account a variety of factors that can impact the final profit. The system calculates profits by analyzing data related to **inflation**, **storage costs in a warehouse**, **delivery paths from warehouse to customer**, **delivery dates**, **order parameters**, and more. The model also allows for the addition of further parameters to enhance its accuracy.

This project uses data from **HIV drug deliveries from USAID** along with a **generated dataset from a large language model (LLM)** to build a predictive system capable of calculating deal profits with a high degree of reliability. The **Explainable AI (XAI)** approach was integrated into the system to provide transparency in the predictions and calculations, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind each profit estimate.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to assist businesses, particularly in industries such as pharmaceuticals and logistics, in optimizing their operations by predicting the profitability of deals with greater accuracy. Traditional methods often fail to account for all the relevant variables, leading to inefficiencies or unexpected costs. By incorporating factors like inflation, storage, delivery paths, and order parameters, this tool aims to provide a more comprehensive view of deal profitability.

Furthermore, as businesses expand, managing profitability becomes increasingly complex. This project offers an easy-to-use solution to calculate potential profits based on historical data and adjustable parameters, while also ensuring the model's decisions are explainable, transparent, and trusted by stakeholders.

## Features

- **Profit Prediction**: Predict the profit for a deal based on multiple factors such as delivery costs, storage, and inflation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily expand the list of parameters for more tailored predictions, including potential future factors.
- **Data Sources**: Utilizes datasets on HIV drug deliveries from USAID and a generated dataset from an LLM for broader insights.
- **Explainable AI**: The model provides clear, understandable explanations for its predictions, helping users make informed decisions and trust the results.

## Datasets Used

- **USAID HIV Drug Delivery Data**: A dataset containing detailed records of drug deliveries, including logistical factors such as delivery dates, routes, and costs associated with each delivery.
- **Generated Dataset from LLM**: A synthetic dataset used to supplement real-world data and enhance the modelâ€™s predictions by generating additional relevant features and patterns.

## Explainable AI

The integration of **Explainable AI (XAI)** is a key component of this project. XAI techniques are used to ensure that the decision-making process of the model is transparent and understandable. This helps users not only to trust the predictions but also to gain insights into which factors (such as delivery path, inflation, or order parameters) are influencing the profit margins the most.

## Conclusion

This project offers a powerful tool for businesses seeking to accurately predict and optimize their deal profits. By leveraging the power of AI and integrating explainability, the system provides actionable insights and empowers users to make more informed decisions. The ability to customize the parameters and include diverse data sources further enhances its adaptability to various business needs.
